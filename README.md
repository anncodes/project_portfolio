# Portfolio Project 
This portfolio project is the result of following the Real Python tutorial while customizing the front end to create a unique and personalized portfolio website. While I did not fork the Real Python repository, I used their tutorial as a foundation to build and showcase my own projects, skills, and experiences.

## Project Overview
This portfolio project serves as a platform for me to display my coding skills, projects, and professional experiences. It is designed to provide a snapshot of my capabilities as a developer and to help potential employers or collaborators learn more about me.

## Features
Home Page: A brief introduction to who I am and what I do.
Projects: A showcase of the projects I've worked on, complete with descriptions, technologies used, and links to their respective repositories or live demos.
Skills: An overview of my technical skills and proficiency in different programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
Experience: Details about my professional experience, including past positions, roles, and responsibilities.
Contact: A way for visitors to get in touch with me, whether it's for job opportunities, collaborations, or general inquiries.
Customisations
While I used the Real Python tutorial as a starting point, I have customized the front end to give the portfolio a unique look and feel that represents my personality and style. Some of the customizations include:

Design: A personalised design that reflects my branding and aesthetics.
Content: Updated content to provide information specific to my skills, projects, and experiences.
Layout: Adjustments to the layout and organization of the portfolio sections to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing.

## Getting Started
To view my portfolio, you can simply visit My Portfolio Website (replace with the actual link to your portfolio). There, you will find detailed information about my work and experiences.
